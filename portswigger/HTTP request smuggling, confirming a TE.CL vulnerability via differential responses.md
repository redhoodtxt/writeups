*This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that a subsequent request for / (the web root) triggers a 404 Not Found response.*

Tried the [](../../courses/bscp/notes/advanced-topics/HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling.md#HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling%20Methodology) with the 2 different payloads, seeing that the first payload generated the following response: 
![Screenshot 2024-06-13 at 6.18.59 PM](images/Screenshot%202024-06-13%20at%206.18.59%20PM.png)

This means that this is either a `TE.CL` or `TE.TE` vulnerability. Let's confirm this with the second payload. 
It gave the following response: 
![Screenshot 2024-06-13 at 6.19.59 PM](images/Screenshot%202024-06-13%20at%206.19.59%20PM.png)
This confirms that this is a `TE.CL` vulnerability. 

I then modified the request as such and sent the request twice, which created the following successful message:
