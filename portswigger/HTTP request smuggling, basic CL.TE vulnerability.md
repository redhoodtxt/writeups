*This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.
To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method GPOST.*

Right clicked homepage request > *Extensions* > *HTTP Request Smuggler >* *Smuggle Probe*. This gave me 3 requests and responses from the scan, where i saw the following from the second `POST` request was successful (`200 OK`)

This had an incomplete smuggled request, so I knew I had to send the request one more time in the Repeater to make sure that the `G` would be appended to the second request, which will complete the smuggled request and create an invalid `GPOST` method.
I hence sent it to the *Repeater* and submitted the same request, which created the following and solved the lab:
