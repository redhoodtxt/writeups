*This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.*

After reached in the "logged in" stage where the website prompts for the verification code, I simply went back to the home page to access the home page with the victim's account, bypassing the 2FA.
