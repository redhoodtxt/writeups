*This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all subdomains regardless of the protocol.
To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter*

Standard response when logging in:

Another interesting I noticed is that when checking stock of a product, you are sent to another subdomain:

I scanned this subdomain to find that it was indeed vulnerable to reflected XSS:

I decided to place the following exploit in my exploit server header:

It was important that i did not include any line breaks as this would cause errors. The code works as each statement is terminated with a `;` (always view exploit and check console)
I also had to encode parts of the script for it to work.
This gave the API key in the access log:

Submitted the API key to solve the lab.
