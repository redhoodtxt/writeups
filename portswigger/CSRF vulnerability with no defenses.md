*This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.
To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter*

Logged into my account and changed my email, viewing the request in *Proxy*:

There is:
1. a relevant action (change email)
2. only a `session` cookie to identify the user
3. a predictable parameter
I hence generated a CSRF PoC:

Pasted the HTML into my exploit server and changed the email address to an arbitrary email that is not in use for the vulnerable website. This is because trying to get the victim to change to my email address will trigger a "email already in use" error. We assume that the arbitrary email is an email that we control.

Stored the exploit and delivered it to the victim, solving the lab.
