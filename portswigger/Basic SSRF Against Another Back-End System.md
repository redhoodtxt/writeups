*This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.X range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user carlos.*

Greeted with the same page with the products. Clicked on a product, which had the *check stock* feature, same as the previous lab. 

Captured the intercept when clicking the *check stock* feature, with the following output from Burp:

 Sent this to Burp Intruder, where I modified the `stockApi` as such below : 
```Burp

The payload I used was a list of numbers from 1 to 256. I then commenced the Sniper attack. 

Sorting the output by status code, I noticed that only 1 payload returned a 200 OK status code, as seen below:

This was for `192.168.0.145`. Sending this to the Repeater, I managed to obtain the following response: 

```Burp 
<div>
	<span>carlos - </span>
	<a href="/http://192.168.0.145:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos">Delete</a>
</div>
```

I then modified the request in the Repeater to the following: 
```Burp
