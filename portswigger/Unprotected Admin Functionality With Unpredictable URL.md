Navigated to the login page and clicked on *View Source* :

![[unprotected admin func with unpredictable url.png]]

As seen from above, the directory `admin-f31dzh` is appended to the URL if the role is *admin* .
I navigated to the directory by : 
```URL 
https://0ad700ea04cb64b78aea278c00ea005e.web-security-academy.net/admin-f31dzh
```
Greeted by the same admin panel where I deleted *carlos*.
