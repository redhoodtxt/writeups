*This lab stores the user's password hash in a cookie. The lab also contains an XSS vulnerability in the comment functionality. To solve the lab, obtain Carlos's stay-logged-in cookie and use it to crack his password. Then, log in as carlos and delete his account from the "My account" page.
Your credentials: wiener:peter
Victim's username: carlos*

Checked the login page for if there was any brute-force protection, and found that I am blocked from logging in for 1 minute after 4 invalid attempts:

Performing the same brute-force tactic as in [Brute-forcing a stay-logged-in cookie](Brute-forcing%20a%20stay-logged-in%20cookie.md) does not work as it results in a 302 status code for all the payloads, with no differences in behaviour.
